# Alpha-Omega
Alpha-Omega is an open-source artificial intelligence library/framework built on numpy and PILLOW still under development.

## The Goals of this Project
As you already know there are many machine learning and artificial intelligence packages available for python such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, spaCy, NLTK, and kinda OpenCV. So why are we developing this package? These are the goals of this project:

 + Simplicity: Have you ever noticed, how many inputs scikit-learn classes and functions have? One of the goals of this project is to develop simple classes and functions for any usage.
 + Comprehensivity: Want to work on a nlp project? use spaCy or NLTK. Oh, you want to build an computer vision system? I recommend you OpenCV. and so on... The other goal of this project is to be a comprehensive package for AI usages, hense the name, Alpha-Omega (although it's a long term goal).
 + Availability: Yeah, this package is for python, but another long term goal for this project is to develop it for other languages such as C++. learn one package. Use it everywhere.
 + Object Oriented and Functionality: Another goal of this project is to provide Classes and Functions for each algorithm and let the user to decide which one to use. Class or the simple functions.
 + Portability: I just wanted to include this word as a goal of this project :) Nothing special.
 
 ## Why should you contribute to this project?
 That's an easy question to answer:
 + You are interested in contributing to open-source projects.
 + You can decoreate your CV with contributing to this project.
 + You gain experience in developing AI algorithms.
 + Last, but not least, I am nor perfect neither I have time to develop this massive package. I need you.
