# Alpha-Omega
Alpha-Omega is an open-source artificial intelligence library/framework built on NumPy and PILLOW still under development. I would appreciate if you contribute to this project if you are a python enthusiast and:

+ Familiar with Computer Vision algorithms,
+ Familiar with classical Machine Learning algorithmsm
+ Familiar with NLP algorithms.

and I will need you in the future if you are a python and C++ enthusiast and:

+ Familiar with Deep Learning algorithms (We are gonna develop the algorithms from zero and only with the help of NumPy and PILLOW, so you should be familiar with how to develop algorithms to calculate gradients, writing code for Optimization algorithms and so.)
+ Familiar with Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
+ Familiar with processing other types of Signals such as Audio (If we have time and every other thing is OK, we are gonna write code for processing other signals too.)
+ and so on... I do not even know what we are going to add to this project right now.

## The Goals of this Project
As you already know there are many machine learning and artificial intelligence packages available for python such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, spaCy, NLTK, and kinda OpenCV. So why are we developing this package? These are the goals of this project:

 + Simplicity: Have you ever noticed, how many inputs scikit-learn classes and functions have? One of the goals of this project is to develop simple classes and functions for any usage.

 + Comprehensivity: Want to work on an NLP project? use spaCy or NLTK. Oh, you want to build a computer vision system? I recommend you OpenCV. and so on... The other goal of this project is to be a comprehensive package for AI usages, hence the name, Alpha-Omega (although it's a long term goal).

 + Availability: Yeah, this package is for python, but another long term goal of this project is to develop it for other languages such as C++. learn one package. Use it everywhere. (This one is a really long-term goal of this project. As long as it is not considered yet.)

 + Object-Oriented and Functionality: Another goal of this project is to provide Classes and Functions for each algorithm and let the user decide which one to use. Class or the simple functions.

 + Portability: I just wanted to include this word as a goal for this project :) Nothing special.
 
 ## Why should you contribute to this project?
 That's an easy question to answer:

 + You can decorate your CV by contributing to this project.
 + You gain experience in developing AI algorithms.
 + Last, but not least, I am nor perfect neither I have time to develop this massive package. I need you.
